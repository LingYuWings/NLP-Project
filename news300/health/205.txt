West Nile Virus Fast Facts  (CNN)West Nile virus (WNV) is primarily transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes.  About 2,300 people have died of West Nile virus in the United States since it was first detected in New York City in 1999.  Facts West Nile virus is usually spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It is not spread person-to-person through casual contact. In rare cases, WNV can be spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants, exposure in a lab setting or from mother to infant. Symptoms of West Nile infection include: fatigue, fever, headache, body aches, rash and swollen lymph nodes. 80% of infected people do not display any symptoms. According to the CDC, less than 1% of infected people develop a serious neuroinvasive illness, such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). There is no vaccine or specific treatment for WNV. The most effective method of prevention is to avoid mosquito bites, by using insect repellent and by wearing protective clothing when outdoors.  1937 - The first case of West Nile virus is reported in Uganda.
