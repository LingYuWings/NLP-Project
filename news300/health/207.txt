Cholera Fast Facts  (CNN)Here's a look at cholera, an acute diarrheal infection that has killed thousands of people worldwide.  Facts Cholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. The bacteria is usually found in water contaminated with feces.  Dehydration from rapid loss of body fluids is the reason the disease can be deadly if the patient is not treated. The disease's short incubation period of two hours to five days increases the likelihood of outbreaks. Oral hydration salts can successfully treat about 80% of cholera patients.  There are three two-dose oral cholera vaccines available, Dukoral, Shanchol and Euvichol. There is also an FDA-approved single-dose oral vaccine in the United States called Vaxchora. Cholera is rare in industrialized nations. People who live in areas with shortages of safe drinking water or inadequate sanitation are vulnerable to cholera.
