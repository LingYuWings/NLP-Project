ACM Awards 2020: Check out who won  (CNN)The Academy of Country Music Awards aired live Wednesday night, bringing together the biggest names in country music. Keith Urban hosted the event from the Grand Ole Opry House to an empty audience amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but the show was spirited.   Among the performers were Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Luke Combs and Tim McGraw. Swift took the show's stage for the first time in seven years to perform "Betty" off her new album, "Folklore."  When it came to the big categories, Old Dominion won group of the year and Luke Combs won album of the year for "What You See Is What You Get." Entertainer of the year, the top ACM prize, was presented last and produced a surprise. Urban seemed shocked when he opened the envelope to announce that this year's winner ended up in a tie between Carrie Underwood and Thomas Rhett. Despite having to share the award, both stars seemed equally thrilled during their acceptance speeches.  Underwood previously won the award in 2009 and 2010. See below for a list of the winners.
