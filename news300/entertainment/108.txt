Chris Evans uses that NSFW pic for a patriotic purpose  (CNN)This is one of those stories that you are going to have to use Google to get the full picture.  Here's what we can say: Over the weekend, Chris Evans appeared to accidentally leak a not suitable for work photo on his verified Instagram account. The photo of a body part people presumed to be his went viral... and let's just say it was a big deal. Plenty of people were saluting the "Captain America" star, as well as teasing him. But Evans is directing all the hoopla toward a good cause. On Tuesday he tweeted, "Now that I have your attention...VOTE Nov 3rd!!!" Way to be an American superhero, sir.  The incident has made Evans the subject of some good-natured jokes, even from his brother and fellow actor, Scott Evans. "Was off social media for the day yesterday," Scott Evans tweeted Sunday. "So. What'd I miss?" Well played, Evans brothers. Well played.
