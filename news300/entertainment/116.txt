'SNL' is returning to 30 Rock for the first time since March New York (CNN Business)The "Saturday Night Live" cast is heading back to studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza for its 46th season. This will be the late-night show's first live episode since March 7, before the pandemic lockdown started taking hold in the United States. "Saturday Night Live" teased the episode on Twitter with a video of the stage, text that reads "October 3" and a voiceover that says, "Live from New York." NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Today.com, the website for NBC's "Today" show, reported "SNL's" return to the studio. On March 16, "Saturday Night Live" said it had suspended production, and on April 11, the show returned for a virtual episode titled "Saturday Night Live At Home." The virtual show kicked off with Tom Hanks -- who previously tested positive for coronavirus -- as its host. Hanks, who was wearing a suit, added that it was the first time he had worn anything other than sweatpants in a month. NBC produced two other virtual episodes, one that aired on April 25 with Brad Pitt doing the cold open, and one that aired on May 9 with Alec Baldwin doing the cold open. "Saturday Night Live" also aired a special compilation of Mother's Day-themed sketches for Mother's Day on May 10.
